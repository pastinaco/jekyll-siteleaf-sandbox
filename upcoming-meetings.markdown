**Our meeting location**

The Fellowship Hall at the First Congregational Church of San Jose, 1980 Hamilton Ave, San Jose, CA 95125

**Our meeting structure**

* Our Wednesday meeting is a traditional, formal meeting. We meet in a large group, share information on upcoming events and action, highlight ways to be effective, perhaps have a guest speaker, and work in small groups.

* Our Saturday meeting is completely action oriented. We will not have a traditional/formal meeting, but we will meet together in shared space to work on action activities from 9:30am-11:30am. We will create hubs to work together on activities such as phone banking, post card writing, working on letters to the editor or op-eds, small discussion groups, making signs, etc. We will post what action opportunities are available for each Saturday meeting. Or, show up and create an action opportunity for a small group! Note: some groups may organize an off-site action opportunity for a Saturday morning, such as a voter registration opportunity.
