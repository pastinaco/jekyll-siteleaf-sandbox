The meeting started with a warm welcome from Rep Eshoo and staff member Fabiola.

Anna started by acknowledging that she is already very familiar with Indivisible and is impressed with how it is influencing change in the new administration.

We discussed health care. Anna provided some insight into how the bill went through committee during mark up with very little (if any?) opposition from Republicans.


She emphasized that the failure of AHCA was unexpected and sent shockwaves through Washington. Many Representatives ended up voting against it after pressure from constituents at their town hall  meetings. She stated that Indivisible groups played an instrumental role in this.

We discussed the withdrawal of funding for the upgrade of Bay Area transit was a huge blow. She has a great deal of experience in this area having been involved with planning since her earliest days in office (Board of Supervisors) and she is working hard to try to find a way to restore funding to upgrade and modernize public transportation in our district.

*Presidential Tax Transparency Act:*

Anna this is a two pronged effort. She has introduced legislation (with co authors....) HR 305 to require that the president and all major presidential candidates be required to release to the public their tax returns from the prior 3 years. She also has submitted a discharge petition that if passed, will require that the bill go directly to the floor for a vote rather than requiring approval of the speaker to send the bill to the floor.

She has just now received some early bipartisan support for this and is very encouraged by this.

She was thrilled to hear our group express our support for this bill and our intention to contact Individual groups across the country so that they can strongly urge their representatives to support this bill and the discharge petition.

*Muslim Ban:*

Anna listened to our concerns that the administrations travel ban and anti immigrant rhetoric has created an atmosphere of fear in the country at large. She expressed her support for diversity and her strong condemnation of the administration's demagoguery. Her office has a great deal of experience helping constituents with Visa and immigration problems.

The meeting concluded very positively with Anna expressing her appreciation of our group and encouraging us to continue using our energy to press on with other issues. She emphasized that the results achieved so far with the defeat of AHCA were impressive and hoped that we would continue our work.
