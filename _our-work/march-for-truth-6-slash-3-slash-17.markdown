Indivisible San Jose showed up to support Indivisible East San Jose's March for Truth!

The demands of the march included:
*An independent commission must be established and Congressional investigations should be properly resourced and pursued free of partisan interests;
*As much information should be made available to the public as possible, and as soon as possible;
Congress should require Donald Trump to release his tax returns to clarify his business interests and obligations to any foreign entity;
*If crimes were committed or if collusion is discovered, prosecution must follow
