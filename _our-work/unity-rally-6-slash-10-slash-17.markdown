Indivisible San Jose signed on as an event cohost of the Unity Rally on June 10, 2017.  We showed up to let our Muslim friends and neighbors know we welcome them in our community. 

Indivisible San Jose endorsed the Statement Against Hate: 

"Residents of the San Francisco Bay Area benefit from both individuals and institutions whose faith motivates them to provide food to the hungry, shelter to the needy, inexpensive or free health care, and other humanitarian services. Our history includes episodes of injustice and harmful conduct based on ethnicity, race, and nationality, but also a strong history of opposing bigotry and embracing all people of good conscience. We value our history of embracing individuals’ right to practice the faith tradition of their choice. Some isolated individuals in our community sometimes hold events designed to foster hatred and fear. Those involved in legally expressing their political opinions must enjoy the protection of our nation’s laws. However, we similarly exercise our speech rights to reject and marginalize hate speech and attempts to divide our communities. We find abhorrent all forms of discrimination, including those forms of discrimination targeting religion or belief. Islamic societies, organizations, places of worship, and communities enrich and benefit the spiritual, moral and cultural life of our community. We oppose any expression of bigotry towards Muslims with the same full moral, legal and practical force that we oppose other forms of discrimination."
