<p><strong>Our meeting structure</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Our Wednesday meeting is a traditional, formal meeting. We meet in a large group, share information on upcoming events and action, highlight ways to be effective, perhaps have a guest speaker, and work in small groups.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Our Saturday meeting is completely action oriented. We will not have a traditional/formal meeting, but we will meet together in shared space to work on action activities from 9:30am-11:30am. We will create hubs to work together on activities such as phone banking, post card writing, working on letters to the editor or op-eds, small discussion groups, making signs, etc. We will post what action opportunities are available for each Saturday meeting. Or, show up and create an action opportunity for a small group! Note: some groups may organize an off-site action opportunity for a Saturday morning, such as a voter registration opportunity.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
