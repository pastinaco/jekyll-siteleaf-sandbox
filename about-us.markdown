Indivisible San Jose is a growing, diverse community who seeks to work together to resist the corrupt, authoritarian and racist agenda of the current administration. We will work together to contact our Members of Congress via daily action items, and seek ways to defend and embrace progressive values. In order to meet our goals, we will provide organization and structure to make our work as user-friendly as possible.

At the same time, we desire to develop a caring community of folks with shared progressive values. Because we know our work is a marathon and not a sprint, we will be more effective working together. All our voices and perspectives are important; therefore we seek inclusion, respect and fairness in our group interactions. We seek to support and affirm those new to political activism, and we desire make a home for the most experienced activist. All are welcome in Indivisible San Jose! We hope the support of our community will allow our members to take risks and try on new roles.
