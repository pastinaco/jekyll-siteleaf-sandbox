h3. "Sister District":https://www.sisterdistrict.com/

The "Sister District Project":https://www.sisterdistrict.com/ organizes residents of relatively "safe blue" districts like CA-18 and CA-19 (where most of Indivisible San Jose members are) to volunteer in a "winnable red" district where their energy and involvement can make a difference.  Indivisible San Jose is working with Sister District to provide organizing help for our sister districts in the 2018 midterms, and possibly some special elections before then.

h3. "Swing Left":https://swingleft.org/

"Swing Left":https://swingleft.org/ is similar to Sister Districts but is focusing on a specific set of Swing Districts.  For Indivisible San Jose there is a nearby Swing District in CA-10.
